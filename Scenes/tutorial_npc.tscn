Its been so cold and lonely ever since the great global cooling…

Anyways…

Welcome to my farm!

It’s a bit cold out so it might be hard to move around…

WASD or arrow keys will help you move around in these rough conditions. Hold shift while pressing any of those keys to briefly dash in that direction.

Oh? You don’t know how to grow things?

First, go over to my good friend Charles the penguin. He’s got the best deals for seeds

To move your seeds, press space. To place them, click while on the square you want to place them. 

The seeds won’t grow in the cold though, bring the handy dandy lamp over by using space to pick it up

Place it right next to your seeds to keep them alive by pressing space where you want to put the lamp. 

Make sure you click on the lamp to turn it on

Wait they still aren’t growing? 

…

Pick up the watering can with space and click on each seed to kickstart their growth

Also, make sure to keep the lamp on, they’ll die out in this cold 

Click on the lamp every once in a while to keep it on

Without the lamp, your plants will slowly freeze to death

At the shop, you can buy upgrades and more lamps!

Oh? You don’t have any money?

You can sell your crops in the nifty little sell box!

Anyways, I gotta go… I heard Romania is above freezing this time of year. Have fun!
